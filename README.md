## 5 Minute Test
Run the Voyage API and execute a JSON API request within 5 minutes

1. Prerequisites 
   - Ensure you have the latest versions of [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/), [SQL Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express) (default instance), and [IIS Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48264) installed.
2. Open Visual Studio with administrator privileges.
   - Right-click on the Visual Studio icon and select "Run as administrator".
3. Download source via Visual Studio GitHub extension
   - Open Visual Studio's "Team Explorer" tab and click the "Manage Connections" button. 
   - Under the GitHub section, click "Clone" and enter your GitHub credentials.
   - Choose "voyage-dotnet-api" from the list of repositories.
     * The official repository is located here https://github.com/lssinc/voyage-api-dotnet
   - Click "Clone". When done cloning, open the "Voyage.API" solution.
4. Create the database
   - Double-click the localhost.publish.xml file.
   - Once the dialog appears, click the Publish button.
5. Run the applications
   - In Visual Studio, with the Voyage.Web project selected, press Ctrl + F5 to launch the Authentication website with IIS Express.
   - Now, with the Voyage.Api selected, press Ctrl + F5 to launch the Web API website with IIS Express.
6. Get an access token
   - Using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps), create a new "POST" request.
   - Set the url to http://localhost:52431/oauth/token
   - In the "Body", use x-www-form-urlencoded and fill in the following key/value pairs:
     - "grant_type" : "Client Credentials"
     - "username" : "admin@admin.com"
     - "password" : "Hello123!"
     - "client_id" : "123456"
     - "client_secret"" : "abcdef"
   - Click "Send". You should receive an access token back.
7. Test the API
   - Using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps), create a new "GET" request.
   - Set the url to http://localhost:55850/api/v1/users
   - Add a header where the key is "Authorization" and the value is "Bearer `<token>`". Replace `<token>` with the full token string from the previous request.
   - Click "Send".
